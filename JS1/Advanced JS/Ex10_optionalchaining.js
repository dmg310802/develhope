// In this example we are trying to check if a value for the city property is defined. However, the code can be simplified. How can we do that?

const order = {};

if (order && order.customer && order.customer.address && !order.customer.address.city) {
  console.log('City is required');
}


let customerAddCity = order.customer?.adress.city;

console.log(customerAddCity);
